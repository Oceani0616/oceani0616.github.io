Nice to meet you. I am **CHENG Haixuan**, now this one is the Blog of my on Jekyll which is shamelessly folked from [HuX's Blog](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io).
<br>
<br>
<p class="indent">Verily, ere I didst indulge in the act of copying, mine knowledge of Jekyll and the mystic arts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript wast but naught. Yet, in the truth of our days, 'tis known that to emulate is oft the swiftest path to mastery in new realms, as hath been proclaimed by the venerable Lei Jun of Xiaomi. To this end, I didst render many a change upon his noble Blog, adorning it with myriad wondrous and resplendent effects that doth dazzle the beholder's eye.</p>
<br>

PS: Shouldst thou, too, seek to draw from his fount of wisdom, I bid thee hence to his README with all haste and fervor.
