This page tells you about Mr.Cheng, a happy loser. 

Cheng had the privilege of being born and raised in Rizhao, a serene and picturesque town nestled along the coastline. In his childhood, he often delighted in lying on the beach, watching the magnificent sea glisten with the warm hues of the setting sun. This place has been witness to countless old tales of youthful exuberance, of sweet melancholy of romantic love, of the courage of the brave and fear, of the seasons of summer and winter alike, spun beneath the watchful gaze of the seasons' eternal dance, his childhood unfolded like a timeless fable from where.

Many, many years have woven their stories through the tapestry of his being, from Beijing to Hong Kong. As he reflect on the past two decades of my life, he realize that he has yet to accomplish any significant milestones. While this may seem like a reason to despair, he chooses to celebrate anyway. He view it as an opportunity to embrace the beauty of simplicity and cherish the present moment without any external pressures to celebrate. 

So he initialize his Blog, an ode to the art of cherishing the now, a testament to the peace that dwells within the folds of the ordinary. Thus, in this spirit, he unfurl the sails of his Blog, a vessel for thoughts serene and untroubled by the tempest of expectation.

Here's to have nothing to celebrate. 
Yet finding within that nothingness a universe of quiet splendor.

May peace be your companion on this journey through my musings.
